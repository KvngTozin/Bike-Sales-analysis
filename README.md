## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Texas** recorded the highest number of product purchases  
- The best-selling product is **not** the most in-demand product  
- The top paying customer made the most orders — none were from the most expensive product  
- **April and May** experienced the highest sales activity

## 🧭 Recommendations  
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to improve sales performance and customer targeting:

1. **Strengthen Marketing Efforts in Texas**  
   Since Texas accounts for the majority of purchases, targeted campaigns and promotional offers in this region can further boost revenue.

2. **Re-evaluate Inventory for In-Demand but Lower-Selling Products**  
   Some products are highly demanded but not among the best-selling.  
   This suggests potential issues with:
   - stock availability  
   - pricing strategies  
   - distribution  
   Conducting a product availability review can help capture lost sales.

3. **Focus Upselling Strategies on Top Customers**  
   High-value customers place frequent orders but not for the most expensive products.  
   Use loyalty programs, bundle offers, or premium product recommendations to increase average order value.

4. **Increase Stock and Promotions During Peak Months (April–May)**  
   With sales peaking in these months, businesses should ensure:
   - higher stock levels  
   - season-specific campaigns  
   - targeted email marketing  

5. **Optimize Low-Selling Products**  
   Products with consistently low sales should be reviewed for:
   - pricing issues  
   - low demand  
   - poor visibility  
   Consider either repositioning them or phasing them out to reduce inventory costs.
